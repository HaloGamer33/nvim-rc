# Base Config

This directory contains the configurations that Neovim will load first, it's called `base-config`
because it's supposed to only load configs that are native to Neovim and don't require any plugins to
work, this way if I mess up with any configuration of the plugins then at least the 'base'
configuration will be loaded.
